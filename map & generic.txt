Answer: In Java, a Map is an interface that represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is associated with a corresponding value. It allows you to store and retrieve elements based on keys rather than indexes.
2. What are the common usages in collections of Map in Java?

Answer: Common usages of Map collections in Java include:
Storing and retrieving data based on keys.
Implementing associative arrays.
Representing relationships between objects.
Counting occurrences of elements in a dataset.
Caching frequently accessed data.
3. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?

Answer: The main differences between HashMap and TreeMap in Java are:
HashMap:
Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, get) on average.
Does not maintain any order of elements.
TreeMap:
Implements the NavigableMap interface and stores key-value pairs in sorted order based on the keys.
Provides logarithmic-time performance for basic operations.
Offers additional methods for navigational operations, such as getting the first or last key.
4. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?

Answer: In Java, you can check if a key exists in a Map by using the containsKey(Object key) method. This method returns true if the Map contains a mapping for the specified key, otherwise false.
5. What are Generics in Java?

Answer: Generics in Java allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of specified types. They provide compile-time type safety by allowing you to specify the type of objects that a collection or method can work with.
6. What are the benefits of using Generics in Java?

Answer: The benefits of using Generics in Java include:
Type safety: Ensures type compatibility at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
Code reusability: Allows writing generic algorithms and data structures that can work with different types.
Improved readability: Makes code more self-documenting by specifying types explicitly.
Performance: Avoids the need for type casting, resulting in better performance.
7. What is a Generic class in Java?

Answer: A Generic class in Java is a class that can operate on a specified type or types. It is declared with one or more type parameters enclosed in angle brackets (<>). These type parameters can be used throughout the class to specify the types of fields, methods, and constructors.
8. What is a Type Parameter in Java Generics?

Answer: A Type Parameter in Java Generics is a placeholder for a specific type or types that a generic class, interface, or method can operate on. Type parameters are declared using angle brackets (<>) and can be used to define the types of fields, parameters, and return types within the generic entity.
9. What is a Generic Method in Java?

Answer: A Generic Method in Java is a method that is declared with one or more type parameters and can operate on objects of specified types. It allows you to create methods that can work with different types without sacrificing type safety. Generic methods are declared by placing type parameters before the return type, similar to generic classes.
10. What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?

Answer: ArrayList is a raw type in Java, while ArrayList<T> is a generic type. ArrayList<T> allows you to specify the type of elements that the ArrayList can contain at compile time, providing type safety and avoiding the need for explicit type casting. Using raw types like ArrayList can lead to runtime errors and is not recommended in modern Java development.
